# MIDI-Soundboard
This is a midi soundboard that is meant to work with a virtual mixing console.

## DON'T JUDGE
This code is old. Do NOT judge this code. I am aware that this is probably not the best code but this was one of my first big projects and I am pretty proud of what I managed to do.

## To-do:
Better README, clean up the code and a bunch of stuff probably. I don't remember.

## Requirements
- A midi device. Preferably an ICON i-Stage which was used with this program.
- This also requires a configuration tool that I made which makes it easy to create different profiles to the buttons and assign sounds. This tool is currently not working because of some outdated framework which I don't know how to upgrade. You can make these files yourself but that is very annoying.
