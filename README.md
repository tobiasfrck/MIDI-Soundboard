# MIDI-Soundboard
This is a midi soundboard that is meant to work with a virtual mixing console.

## DON'T JUDGE
This code is old. Do NOT judge this code. I am aware that this is probably not the best code but this was one of my first big projects and I am pretty proud of what I managed to do.

## To do:
Better README, clean up the code and a bunch of stuff probably. I don't remember.

## Requirements
A midi device. Preferably an ICON i-Stage which was used with this program.
