# MIDI-Soundboard
This is a midi soundboard that is meant to work with a virtual mixing console.

## Why is this cool?
It has the ability to change the audio deivce. That's it. Isn't that awesome? Well, it was back then, ok?\
With this you can select an audio input in Voicemeeter for example and route the sounds to your mic and your headphones.\
It can also have multiple pages of sounds and has the ability to spawn a black window to make cheap screens with low refresh rate bearable.

## DON'T JUDGE
This code is old. Do NOT judge this code. I am aware that this is probably not the best code but this was one of my first big projects and I am pretty proud of what I managed to do.

## To-do:
Better README, clean up the code and a bunch of stuff probably. I don't remember.

## Requirements
- A midi device. Preferably an ICON i-Stage which was used with this program.
- This also requires a configuration tool that I made which makes it easy to create different profiles to the buttons and assign sounds. This tool is currently not working because of some outdated framework which I don't know how to upgrade. You can make these files yourself but that is very annoying.
